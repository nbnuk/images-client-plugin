### images-client-plugin   [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nbnuk/images-client-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/nbnuk/images-client-plugin)
images-client-plugin
====================

This plugin provides a reusable image viewer component based on [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).

The grails2 branch contains the 0.8.x series of the plugin compatible with Grails 2.x

The master branch hosts version 1.x and forward of the plugin compatible with grails 3.x


## Usage

`compile "au.org.ala.plugins.grails:images-client-plugin:1.0", noCache`

The `image-viewer` resources module need to be added to the page where we want to use the viewer. Eg using the Asset Pipeline plugin:

``` html
<asset:javascript src="ala/images-client.js"/>
<asset:stylesheet src="ala/images-client.css" />

```

:exclamation: This will create a viewer instance in the document global scope called `imgvwr`.

:warning: To display a tiled image we need the `imageId` as per the [images.ala.org.au](http://images.ala.org.au) service and the id of the `<div>` element that will contain the viewer as parameters of the `viewImage` method. Eg:

```
imgvwr.viewImage($("#viewerContainerId"), imageId, {custom options...});
```

## Thumbnails gallery component

This component converts our viewer component into an fully feature image gallery where you can easily switch between a given set of images that are conveniently presented as thumbnails in an image carousel sitting bellow our already familiar zoomable image viewer. You might be able to picture it better in the following screenshot:

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ge8X0p1.png?1)

The thumbnail carousel is actually a slighltly modified implementation of the [SliderPro](https://github.com/bqworks/slider-pro/) component. These are some of the features it provides around this use case:

* Responsive layout that automatically adjust to available width.
* Thumbnail automatically resized/cropped so all have the same size.
* High level of accessibility due to keyboard support.
* Touch/Swipe friendly for mobile devices.

### Usage

To create the image gallery we need to position the viewer and the thumbnail carousel in out page. The embedded style sheet support the following HTML layout by default:

```html
<div class="img-gallery">
  <div id="imageViewer"></div>
  <div id="carousel" class="slider-pro">
    <div class="sp-slides thumbnails" style="display: none;">
      <g:each in="${occurrence.imageIds}" var="imageId" status="index">
          <div class="sp-slide">
              <img class="sp-image" />
              <img class="sp-thumbnail" src="${occurrence.imageUrls[index]}" img-id="${imageId}"/>
          </div>
      </g:each>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

To instantiate the image thumbnail gallery you just need the id of the corresponding `<div>` container and the custom options if any:

```javascript
new GalleryWidget('carousel', {options}
```

The following snippet example initialises the thumbnail gallery and the viewer:
```javascript
...
var customViewerOptions = {
    imageServiceBaseUrl: imageServiceBaseUrl,
    galleryOptions: {                 // Note #1
        enableGalleryMode: true,
        showFullScreenControls: true
    }
};

new GalleryWidget('carousel', {
    gotoThumbnail: function() {       // Note #2
        imgvwr.removeCurrentImage();
        var selectedImageId = $('#carousel').find('.sp-selected-thumbnail > img').attr('img-id');
        imgvwr.viewImage($("#imageViewer"), selectedImageId, $.extend(customViewerOptions, commonOptions));
    }
});

imgvwr.viewImage($("#imageViewer"), images[0], $.extend(customViewerOptions,commonOptions));
```

**#1** - The viewer requires some options to be set to integrate the viewer gallery related controls with the thumbnail carousel. Please check these options in the corresponding section bellow :point_down:

**#2** - The GalleryWidget options are those available in the SliderPro component, but many of them do not apply to the thumbnail gallery: [SliderPro options](https://github.com/bqworks/slider-pro/blob/master/docs/api.md#1-properties). :exclamation:The `gotoThumbnail` property needs to be provided always to see the selected image in the viewer.

### Image viewer gallery related options
| Option  | Default | Description
| ------- | ------- | -----------
| enableGalleryMode | false | Need to be set to true if we want the viewer to take into consideration the other options available.
| closeControlContent | null | In the case that the viewer is opened in a modal dialog or something similar, you need a button with the markup required to close the dialog. :warning:The close control button is hidden in full screen mode. See example #1
| showFullScreenControls | false | if true the viewer will show a control bar with two buttons to show the previous and next images. :warning: These controls are only displayed in full-screen mode.

**Example #1**:
```javascript
galleryOptions: {
    enableGalleryMode: true,
    closeControlContent: '<i class="fa fa-times" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close" style="line-height:1.65;"></i>',
    showFullScreenControls: true
}
```
In this example the `closeControlContent` property adds a font-awesome icon to the control and adds the necessary markup to close a Bootstrap 3 modal dialog when it is clicked:

### Image thumbnail gallery carousel default settings
Check the [SliderPro documentation](https://github.com/bqworks/slider-pro/blob/master/docs/api.md#1-properties) for more information.

```javascript
var defaultOptions = {
    width: '100%',
    height: '100%',
    fade: true,
    arrows: false,
    buttons: false,
    fullScreen: false,
    shuffle: false,
    thumbnailArrows: true,
    autoplay: false
};
```

All those can be overridden when creating the `GalleryWidget` instance.

### Configuration
| Config | Description
| ------ | -----------
| speciesList.baseURL | SpeciesList BaseURL (eg: https://lists.ala.org.au)
| bieService.baseUrl | Bie Index BaseURL (eg: http://bie.ala.org.au/ws)
| speciesList.preferredSpeciesListDruid | Preferred Species List Druid (eg: dr4778)
| speciesList.preferredListName | Preferred Species List Name (eg: ALA Preferred Species Images)
| allowedImageEditingRoles | User roles for users to be able to nominate preferred image for species. (eg: ROLE_ADMIN,ROLE_USER)
